## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: From this module I got the basic understanding of what TypeScript(TS) is and why do we need it. TS is a superset of JavaScript(JS) or in other words it extends JavaScrypt. The main idea is that in TS we identify the type of data and if something goes wrong we can catch the problem immediately.
   TS also needs to be compiled to JS as browsers can read and understand only JS code. And based on uderstanding that TS extends JS, we can make a conclusion that when we write in JS this code can become a TS code but not vice versa. And from this module I also learned how to install a compiler.

2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: The main idea of this module is to show what type of data are available in TS and how to assotiate them to the variables. It also gives more understanding why static types are more preferable than dynamic.
   Since we immediately make it clear what type of data will be used and this is checked as the code is written, any addional resources are not wasted during the program execution.
Also this module gives us an overview of  types in TS. In general they are the same as in JS but not exactly. We can see some additional types such as enum, void, interface and literals and etc.
Enum, for example, is very useful one. It lets us structure similar elements and assigns them with the indexes. It's kind of a mixture of arrays and objects. We can access an element by name or index. So in real life programming we don't need to create a lot of variables for similar objects.
Also the module provides us with the useful information of how to use type assertion if our initial variable had to be declared with the unknown type.
