Hello! My name is Antonina Tyurina and I'm a student of RS School. I was born 33 years ago in Almaty city, Kazakhstan. Funny fact: my mom's russian ancestor were exiled to Kazakhstan from central part of Russian as well as my dad's korean ancestor from the Far East of Russia. So, technically, I was born just because of terrible historical events.

In 2012, I graduated from the Kazakh university of International Relationship and World Languages with a bachelor degree in public law.

Then I got Erasmus Mundus Scholarship and moved to Italy for one year. I studied tax law there and traveled a lot around the Europe. Feels like it was one of the most wonderful experience in my life.

Then, after returning back to reality (I mean to Kazakhstan) I started working for one of the biggest international consulting companies Ernst&Young (EY) at the law department. I started at the position of intern and quitted from the position of senior lawyer after almost five years in company. It was great and very useful experience when I spent in the office for 12-16 hours every day. And during my first vacation for four years I decided to go to Nepal where I met my future husband. Just near the Everest base camp.

And after six months of our relationships we decided that I should move to him. And I moved to Moscow to live here with my husband. First two years after that we traveled a lot. During that time I never spent more than 30 days in one place. That was my favourite time).

After that time I started to think what I really want to do with my professional life. I felt like I don't want to come back to law as I never actually enjoyed this profession. I always wanted to see the result of my work and when you work as a lawyer it's almost impossible. You just can't physically see merger or acquisition of companies. All you see is the bunch of papers.

Yeap, I am a bright representative of the millennial generation who does not understand what I actually want to do in this life!

My husband also told me that i can take my time and decide what I really want to do with my life. At that time my friend asked me to help him with construction of website using Joomla CMS. And to my surprise I liked it. And after couple of months I realised that I want to understand more and not just move components from one place of the page to another. The same friend of mine told me about RS School.

And that is where my struggle for survival began.

It is actually my second try as the first time I was expelled for unfulfilled tasks as I went to Elbrus and I didn't have proper internet connection there. And if to say truth the first time was really hard to me as I had no experience and even 0 stage didn't help much.

As for this time I cannot say that it became much easier but I started to understand more.  And I really enjoy the process and the results of my study. I still have no confidence but I can't give up.

The last task Nonograms gave me better understanding of rendering of the web page without HTML just using JS and CSS. I also tried to use modules. And overall i really liked this task ) I rewrite my code hundred of times and especially I enjoyed the moment when after two days of struggling I understood why my keys do not want to rerender. I just forgot to reset the arrays!

What I like in programming more that anything else is that everything here is logically constructed and if your code doesn't work the reason is just you! You have to learn more!!!


Thank you for your attention!
